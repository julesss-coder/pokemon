A pokemon game in Java, using TDD with Maven

Task: Implement a Pokemon game in Java. 
Task description in German: https://wiki.streampy.at/index.php?title=Java_-_I/O_und_Exceptions#Kampf 

I implemented a simplified version of the game (generating random attack points, as opposed to letting users choose "abilities" and calculating the associated attack points).
